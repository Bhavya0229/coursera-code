<h2>CHICKEN</h2>
A chicken is a bird. 
One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles.
 The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are secondary sexual characteristics and are more prominent in the male. 
 A few other birds have a comb or similar appendage, in some cases bearing a different name such as helmet in the guinea, and a few have wattles with some having a single median one rather than a pair.
 The comb is the basis of the Latin name or classification of chickens.</div>

 <h2>BEEF</h2>
 Beef comes from the domestic cow, Bos taurus, and is the most frequently consumed meat in the United States.
 There is a large variety of beef cattle breeds, but Hereford and Angus are the most common. Beef is available in a wide variety of cuts that can fulfill many different recipe needs. 
 Although the word "beef" is used to describe the meat from this one animal, the truth is that there are many different textures, tastes, and characteristics found within any particular cut. 
 Even within the same cut, various types of beef (for example, Angus from the United States versus Kobe beef from Japan) vary.
